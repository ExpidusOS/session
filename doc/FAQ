Session manager FAQ:
--------------------

1) Question:
     expidus1-session complains about /tmp/.ICE-unix should be set to root. What
     should I do?

   Answer:
     This is just a security warning. You can either ignore, or change the
     owner of /tmp/.ICE-unix to root. For example, I execute the following
     commands on system startup:

       test -d /tmp/.ICE-unix || mkdir /tmp/.ICE-unix
       chown root /tmp/.ICE-unix
       chmod 1777 /tmp/.ICE-unix


2) Question:
     What do I need to do in order to use expidus1-session as session manager
     with Expidus4?

   Answer:
     If you have a recent expidus-utils (post 20030708) then expidus1-session
     is automatically started by startexpidus1 as long as you don't have
     a file ~/.expidus1/xinitrc in your home directory. Alternatively you
     can copy the file $sysconfdir/expidus1/xinitrc.expidus1-session to
     ~/.expidus1/xinitrc and start your X session using the startexpidus1 script.
