.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the

command.
.PP
The \fBexpidus1-session\fP program starts up the Expidus Desktop Environment and
is typically executed by your login manager (e.g. xdm, gdm, kdm, wdm or from
your X startup scripts). It will load your last session or a default session
that includes the standard Expidus programs if no saved session is available.

\fBexpidus1-session\fP is an standard X11R6 session manager that can manage
any X11R6 SM compliant program, including GNOME and KDE programs.

\fBexpidus1-session\fP uses the contents of the ~/.cache/sessions/ directory
for starting previously saved sessions.
